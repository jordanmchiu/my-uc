# My UC
There are many apps and tools to track gut health for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) or other forms of IBD and IBS.  Some of these apps do some things very well: symptom tracking, data visualization, diet tracking, exercise, medication, and mental health.  But there are none that marry all of these concepts effectively to create a more holistic experience.

My-UC aims to be that app.  It will be a cross-platform app to provide patients with detailed and accurate tracking, informative data analysis, and information security.
